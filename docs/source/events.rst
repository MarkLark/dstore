Events
######

Introduction
============
DStore makes the use of an Event Manager in the Store and Models themselves.

These events allow you to hook custom code before or after an action takes place.

In fact, this is exactly how DStore-ACL works to provide a security layer to DStore Models.

Listening To Events
-------------------
Listening to an event is as easy as adding your method to the event in question.

For example, to listen to before_init_app on the store:

.. code-block:: python

    from dstore import MemoryStore

    def before_init_app( event, store ):
        print( "Before init store %s" % store.name )

    def after_init_app( event, store ):
        print( "After init store %s" % store.name )

    store = MemoryStore()
    store.events.before_init_app += before_init_app
    store.events.after_init_app  += after_init_app

    store.init_app()

Store Events
============
To listen to a store event, you add your method to the store's event object.

.. code-block:: python

    store.events.before_init_app += method_to_call

init_app
--------
This event is fired before and after you execute store.init_app()

.. py:function:: before_init_app( event, store )
                 after_init_app( event, store )

    .. py:attribute:: store

        The Data Store that init_app is being run on

destroy_app
-----------
This event is fired before and after you execute destroy_app on a store

.. py:function:: before_destroy_app( event, store )
                 after_destroy_app( event, store )

    .. py:attribute:: store

        The Data Store that destroy_app is being run on

register_models
---------------
This event is fired before and after all models have been registered.

This happens automatically when init_app is run on the store

.. py:function:: before_register_models( event, store )
                 after_register_models( event, store )

    .. py:attribute:: store

        The Data Store that register_models is being run on

register_model
--------------
This event is fired when a single Model is being registered on the store.

.. py:function:: before_register_models( event, store, model )
                 after_register_models( event, store, model )

    .. py:attribute:: store

        The Data Store that register_models is being run on

                 after_destroy_all( event, store )

    .. py:attribute:: store

        The Data Store that destroy_all is being run on

empty_all
---------
This event is fired before and after you execute empty_all on a store

.. py:function:: before_empty_all( event, store )
                 after_empty_all( event, store )

    .. py:attribute:: store

        The Data Store that empty_all is being run on

connect
-------
This event is fired before and after you execute connect on a store

.. py:function:: before_connect( event, store )
                 after_connect( event, store )

    .. py:attribute:: store

        The Data Store that connect is being run on

disconnect
----------
This event is fired before and after you execute disconnect on a store

.. py:function:: before_disconnect( event, store )
                 after_disconnect( event, store )

    .. py:attribute:: store

        The Data Store that disconnect is being run on


Model Events
============
To listen to a store event, you add your method to the store's event object.

.. code-block:: python

    from dstore import MemoryStore, Model, var, mod

    class Car( Model ):
        _namespace = "cars.make"
        _vars = [
            var.RowID,
            var.String( "manufacturer", 32, mods = [ mod.NotNull() ] ),
            var.String( "make", 32, mods = [ mod.NotNull() ] ),
            var.Number( "year", mods = [ mod.NotNull(), mod.Min( 1950 ), mod.Max( 2017 ) ] ),
        ]

    def car_before_add( event, model, instance ):
        print( "Attempting to add a new %s instance" % model._namespace )

    Car.events.before_add += car_before_add
